# LTCsync: a desktop utility for syncing media files

LTCsync is a post-production tool for two-system sound and multi-camera workflows.
Productions use Tentacle Sync, Lockit, and similar devices to embed timecode (LTC) in audio tracks of cameras and audio recorders.
LTCsync extracts this timecode and exports files that NLEs can import directly, with your media all in sync.

LTCsync targets MacOS, Windows and Linux.
